# Sample Buffalo app with Vue.js frontend

Based on https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2017/using-vue-with-buffalo/

This demo app has a Go backend managing the REST API endpoints and talking to a MySQL database. The frontend uses Webpack and NPM to set up a Vue single page app (with vue-router and bootstrap-vue).
